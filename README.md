# CMS


Simple Content Management System (CMS) from scratch using C#. This project allows you to dive into various aspects of software development, including database design, user authentication, and overall system architecture.

Here's a suggested breakdown into iterations:

* Iteration 1: Basic Structure

    Set up a project structure.
Implement user registration and authentication.
Create a basic database schema for user data.

* Iteration 2: Content Management

    Add functionality to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) content.
Implement a simple text editor for content creation.

* Iteration 3: Permissions and Roles

    Introduce roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
Implement access control to restrict certain actions based on user roles.

* Iteration 4: UI/UX Enhancement

    Improve the user interface for better user experience.
Implement features like pagination and search for content.

* Iteration 5: Version Control for Content

    Add versioning to the content to track changes over time.
Implement the ability to roll back to previous versions.

* Iteration 6: Security Measures

    Enhance security by implementing measures such as input validation and protection against common vulnerabilities.

* Iteration 7: Deployment

    Prepare the application for deployment.
Choose a hosting solution and deploy your CMS.

2. camelCase: Use camelCase for variable names and parameters. Example: totalCount, userInfo, calculateDiscount.

3. UpperCase: Use uppercase for constants. Example: MAX_VALUE, PI.

* Interface Naming: Prefix interfaces with the letter "I". Example: IFoo, IBar.

* Interface Naming: Prefix interfaces with the letter "I". Example: IFoo, IBar.

* Namespace: Use meaningful namespaces to organize your code logically.

* void Abbreviations: Use descriptive names instead of abbreviations to enhance code readability.

* Null Checking: Explicitly check for null where necessary, and use the ?? operator for default values.
